# CloudSmith  ☁️🚀
**A Cloud-Native Deployment Platform for One-Click Web App Deployments**

CloudSmith is a developer-centric CI/CD platform that lets you deploy web apps directly from GitHub with a single click. Powered by event-driven microservices and scalable AWS infrastructure, CloudSmith automates the entire pipeline — from GitHub OAuth to production deployment. 
It is my version of a minimalist PaaS offering inspired by Vercel, Heroku from Salesforce, Netlify and Hostinger.

## 📦 Architecture Overview

- **Authspire** – Manages GitHub OAuth and session validation  
- **Launchboard** – UI for repo selection and deployment triggers  
- **Gitpulse, Buildrelay, Docksage** – Kafka-driven microservices for orchestrating builds and deployments  
- **Jenkins** – Builds and uploads repo artifacts to S3  
- **AWS Lambda** – Triggers containerization and service registration  
- **Docker + ECR + ECS/Fargate** – Builds, pushes, and deploys containers at scale  
- **DynamoDB + S3** – Tracks deployment state and stores build artifacts  
- **Application Load Balance ALB** – Exposes live deployed apps via DNS

## ⚖️ Auto-scaling

CloudSmith ensures efficient, demand-based scalability across its deployment infrastructure:

- **Amazon ECS Auto Scaling**: Services deployed via **AWS Fargate** automatically scale based on CPU and memory utilization, ensuring consistent performance under varying loads without manual intervention.  
- **Jenkins Load Management**: Build workloads are processed asynchronously and decoupled via Kafka, preventing bottlenecks during burst traffic.  
- **Kafka-Driven Microservices**: Gitpulse, Buildrelay, and Docksage consume events independently, allowing them to scale horizontally based on topic traffic and system demand.
